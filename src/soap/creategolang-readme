Creating a SOAP service in Golang involves several steps, including setting up the server, defining the SOAP endpoints, and handling SOAP requests and responses. Here's a basic example to get you started:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   
   You'll need to install a Golang SOAP library. For this example, we'll use the `github.com/hooklift/gowsdl` package to generate Go types from a WSDL file.

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/hooklift/gowsdl/...
   ```

2. **Generate Go Types from WSDL:**

   You need a WSDL file that defines your SOAP service. Create a `wsdl` folder and place your WSDL file there.

   ```bash
   mkdir wsdl
   ```

   Place your WSDL file (e.g., `example.wsdl`) in the `wsdl` folder.

   Run the following command to generate Go types from the WSDL:

   ```bash
   gowsdl -o generated/ wsdl/example.wsdl
   ```

3. **Create the SOAP Service:**

   Now, create a Go file (e.g., `main.go`) and define your SOAP service using the generated types.

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "net/http"

       "github.com/hooklift/gowsdl/soap"
       "github.com/hooklift/gowsdl/wsdl"
   )

   // Define your SOAP service implementation
   type ExampleService struct{}

   // Implement the SOAP operation defined in the WSDL
   func (s *ExampleService) Add(request *AddRequest) (*AddResponse, error) {
       result := request.A + request.B
       return &AddResponse{Result: result}, nil
   }

   func main() {
       // Create a new SOAP service
       exampleService := new(ExampleService)

       // Initialize the SOAP server
       server := soap.NewServer()
       server.Register(exampleService)

       // Define the SOAP endpoint
       http.Handle("/example", server)

       // Start the HTTP server
       http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
   }
   ```

4. **Run the Service:**

   Run your Golang application to start the SOAP service:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   Your SOAP service will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/example`.

Remember to replace `example.wsdl` with your actual WSDL file and adjust the service implementation according to your specific SOAP service requirements.
